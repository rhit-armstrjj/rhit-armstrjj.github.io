I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the following projects/assets I used to make this website.

## Jekyll
Although I hate Ruby, this project is really cool.

## Minimal Mistakes
[Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) is a wonderful, simple theme that happened to pop up first in `#jekyll-theme` search on GitHub. In all seriousness, its a great theme and I am grateful that its free to use.

## Assets Used
